# Jonathan Mason Grier

Welcome to my GitHub.

I’m transitioning from a successful background in food service and operational leadership into the field of Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. Through hands-on training with TripleTen’s Data Analytics Bootcamp, I’ve developed strong skills in tools like Tableau, Power BI, SQL, and Excel to uncover actionable insights and support data-driven decision making.

## What I'm Working On

**Restaurant Analytics Project**  
Analyzing restaurant data from Zomato to identify the most popular and profitable restaurants. This includes building a custom popularity score based on orders, revenue, and ratings, and visualizing the results through interactive Tableau dashboards.

**Power BI Dashboard Development**  
Creating business performance dashboards using real-world retail datasets. Focused on clear data storytelling through dynamic KPIs and visuals that drive business understanding.

Continuously improving my skills in SQL, dashboard design, and analytical problem solving. I'm currently exploring ways to enhance data clarity and visual storytelling across multiple platforms.
